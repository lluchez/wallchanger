# WallChanger

WallChanger periodically changes your desktop background image from using pictures from folders or playlists.
WallChanger is simple to use as you only need to define groups (by selecting a folder or creating a text-file), select the rotation interval and you're done.
Once started WallChanger is accessible from the systray.
